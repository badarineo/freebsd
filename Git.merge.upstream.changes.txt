what to do, when your forked repository is behind the original repository? 

Clone your fork:

#git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git
#cd into/cloned/fork-repo

Add remote from original repository in your forked repository:

#git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
#git fetch upstream

Updating your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:

#git pull upstream master
#git push
